# Added Functionality and UI Updates

### Files Added:
- `future_tests_index.html`
- `future_tests_style.css`
- `future_tests_script.js`
---

### Features:
- **Integrated NHS Logo:** Added the NHS logo on the top-left corner of the page via URL.
- **Footer Adjustment:** Ensured the footer stays fixed at the bottom of the page, regardless of content height.
- **"Show More" Option:** Implemented a "Show More" toggle for the Gene Panel and HGNC IDs in the results section, enhancing readability for longer content.
- **Confirmation Modal:** Added a confirmation modal before creating new patient or R code records to prevent accidental submissions.

### Note:
This feature requires **testing** to ensure:
1. UI elements render correctly across different screen sizes.
2. The "Show More" functionality behaves as expected and correctly toggles content.
3. The confirmation modal logic works without interfering with existing features or user flow.
